ASP.NET 4 was not registered in IIS. Had to run the following command in the command line/run

32bit (x86) Windows


%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\aspnet_regiis.exe -ir

64bit (x64) Windows


%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\aspnet_regiis.exe -ir

Note from David Murdoch's comment: 


That the .net version has changed since this Answer was posted. Check which version of the framework is in the %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64 directory and change the command accordingly before running (it is currently v4.0.30319)
